# Primo VS Code Theme

## Build and Install

1. Install `yarn`
2. Run `yarn build` from the root of the repo to build the theme files
3. Run `yarn package` to generate the VSIX
4. Install the VSIX extension file
5. Then [select a theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes#_selecting-the-color-theme). The GitHub themes try to match the themes available in [github.com's settings](https://github.com/settings/appearance):
    - `GitHub Light Default`
    - `GitHub Light High Contrast` ✨ new ✨
    - `GitHub Light Colorblind` ✨ new ✨
    - `GitHub Dark Default`
    - `GitHub Dark High Contrast`
    - `GitHub Dark Colorblind` ✨ new ✨
    - `GitHub Dark Dimmed`

## Override this theme

To override this (or any other) theme in your personal config file, please follow the guide in the [color theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme) documentation. This is handy for small tweaks to the theme without having to fork and maintain your own theme.
